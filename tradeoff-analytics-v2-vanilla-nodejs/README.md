  The IBM Watson [Tradeoff Analytics][service_url] service helps you make
  better choices under multiple conflicting goals. The service combines smart
  visualization and recommendations for tradeoff exploration.

Give it a try! Click the button below to fork into IBM DevOps Services and deploy your own copy of this application on Bluemix.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/dolev.dotan/tradeoff-analytics-v2-nodejs-vanilla)

## Getting Started

1. Create a Bluemix Account

    [Sign up][sign_up] in Bluemix, or use an existing account.

2. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool

3. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change the `<application-name>` to something unique.
  ```none
  applications:
  - services:
    - tradeoff-analytics-standard-service
    name: <application-name>
    command: node app.js
    path: .
    memory: 128M
  ```
  The name you use will determinate your application url initially, e.g. `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

4. Connect to Bluemix in the command line tool.
  ```sh
  $ cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  $ cf login -u <your user ID>
  ```

5. Create the Tradeoff Analytics service in Bluemix.
  ```sh
  $ cf create-service tradeoff_analytics standard tradeoff-analytics-standard-service
  ```

6. Push it live!
  ```sh
  $ cf push
  ```

See the full [Getting Started][getting_started] documentation for more details, including code snippets and references.

## Running locally
  The application uses [Node.js][http://nodejs.org/] and [npm][https://www.npmjs.com/] so you will have to download and install them as part of the steps below.

1. Copy the credentials from your `tradeoff-analytics-standard-service` service in Bluemix to `app.js`, you can see the credentials using:

    ```sh
    $ cf env <application-name>
    ```
    Example output:
    ```sh
    System-Provided:
    {
    "VCAP_SERVICES": {
      "tradeoff_analytics": [{
          "credentials": {
            "url": "<url>",
            "password": "<password>",
            "username": "<username>"
          },
        "label": "tradeoff-analytics",
        "name": "tradeoff-analytics-standard-service",
        "plan": "standard"
     }]
    }
    }
    ```

    You need to copy `username`, `password` and `url`.

2. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
3. Go to the project folder in a terminal and run:
    `npm install`
4. Start the application
5.  `node app.js`
6. Go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot your Bluemix app the main useful source of information are the logs, to see them, run:

  ```sh
  $ cf logs <application-name> --recent
  ```
